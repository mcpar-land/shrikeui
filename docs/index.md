# Shrike UI

Shrike UI is a work in progress. One day, it will be a killer ergonomic React UI Component library.

It takes strong inspiration from [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), and [Material UI](http://material-ui.com/).

It uses 100% [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).
